# financial-calculators
Week 1 Workshop

This project contains 3 financial calculators and all the logic required to run them.
They are all contained in their own files, and are accessed through the code located inside Interface.java.
I would argue that the "most interesting" part of the project of the program is Interface.java itself, as we were not yet taught in class how to call other files in the way that that file does, and it is something I had to learn on my own.

The code for Interface.java is shown below.
